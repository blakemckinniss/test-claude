# Claude Flow Swarm Test Game

This project is initialized with a Claude Flow Swarm consisting of 3 agents:

## Swarm Configuration
- **Swarm ID**: swarm_1753456336610_yyv59ngxe
- **Topology**: Mesh (peer-to-peer coordination)
- **Strategy**: Auto (intelligent task analysis)
- **Max Agents**: 3

## Active Agents

### 1. SwarmLead (Coordinator)
- **Type**: Coordinator
- **Role**: Manages overall coordination, task assignment, and progress monitoring
- **ID**: agent_1753456354340_zfbfq3

### 2. SystemAnalyst (Researcher)
- **Type**: Researcher
- **Role**: Analyzes requirements, researches solutions, and gathers information
- **ID**: agent_1753456354347_tkgox4

### 3. SolutionDesigner (Architect)
- **Type**: Architect
- **Role**: Designs system architecture and technical solutions
- **ID**: agent_1753456354352_oyrigu

## Getting Started

The swarm is now initialized and ready to tackle complex tasks. Each agent has specific capabilities and they coordinate through the mesh topology, allowing direct peer-to-peer communication.

To interact with the swarm, you can:
1. Assign tasks using the task orchestration system
2. Monitor progress through swarm status checks
3. Review collective memory for insights and decisions
4. Track todo items for task completion

## Current Status

üêù **Swarm Status**: ACTIVE
üìä **Tasks**: 1 orchestrated (Initialize coordination framework)
üíæ **Memory**: 5 coordination points stored
